# refactor-reacto

Fork this repo. You have 30 minutes to refactor it as much and as well as you can. Note: don't remove any console.logs, you should assume those are left intentionally. Aim to make this code readable and maintainable, while maintaining all current functionality. As a bonus, you can also aim to make performance improvements (like improving time or space efficiency) but the main task is improving code readability and your changes should not affect code output.

NOTE: The API is fake so this won't run. Assume/pretend it currently works.
